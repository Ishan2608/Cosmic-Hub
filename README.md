# Space Geeks Frontend (Work in Progress)

I am trying to develop a web application using API services related to Space. This website will have multiple features like, Interactive Solar System Model, Image Gallery, Space Events Calender, News, etc. This repository contains the frontend code only. You can view the frontend [here](https://ishan2608.github.io/SpaceGeek/).

I will be developing the backend in Python programming language, using its Flask framework. Some API calls will be made directly by the frontend, and some will be made by the backend. Tha link to the backend source code will be provided soon. Currently the "Read More", "save" and "open" buttons do not work in the APO, events and news section respectively.

If you have idea that can improve the site, whether it is a feature or the overall UI, do let me know. I am open to making this project be able to do... MORE.

NOTE: The website is not 100% responsive. I am having some troubles in that area. It would be great to receive your help.
