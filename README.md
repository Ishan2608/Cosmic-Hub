# Space Geeks Frontend (Work in Progress)

I am trying to develop a web application using API services related to Space. This website will have multiple features like, Interactive Solar System Model, Image Gallery, Space Events Calender, News, etc.

I will be developing the backend in Python programming language, using its Flask framework. Some API calls will be made directly by the frontend, and some will be made by the backend.

I received an assignment to create a custom website using APIs, this is my "try" to complete that.
